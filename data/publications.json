      "abstract": "Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI) are systems that allow users to transmit commands to computers using brain activity. This study explored how individuals with ADHD interacted with a gamified BCI task compared to a non-gamified standard one. Results indicated that the Gamified environment scored higher on Sensory and Imaginative Immersion while scoring lower on Negative Affect.",
