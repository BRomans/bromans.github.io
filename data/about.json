  "bio": "I am Michele Romani, a PhD student in Computer Science specializing in Brain-Computer Interfaces. I come from Asola, a little town in Northern Italy near the beautiful Garda lake. As far as I remember, I have always been passionate about understanding our relationship with technology. I strongly believe that my work should have a positive impact on the relationship between humans and technology, and that AI will play a major role in better understanding the underlying cognitive processes of the brain. At the core, I see myself as a designer: my work lies at the intersection between technology and human behavior, focused on enhancing the interaction between users and computers through Human-Centered AI applications.",
