  "bio": "I am Michele Romani, and I come from Asola, a little town in the countryside of Northern Italy near the beautiful Garda lake. As far as I remember, I have always been passionate about understanding our relationship with technology. I clearly remember the first time I used a computer: it was an immediate click. It was not just a mere work tool, but an extension of my brain, and one that allowed me to progressively unleash my creativity and cultivate my skills like anything else before. I delved into drawing, editing, modding games, learnt English, problem solving, and then when years later I begun my studies and started programming seriously, I realized that my initial intuition was correct and I could achieve much more by implementing my own intuitions and ideas into real applications. I strongly believe that my work should have a positive impact on the relationship between humans and technology, and that AI will play a major role in better understanding the underlying cognitive processes of the brain in the next iteration of neuro-scientific research and applications. At the core, I see myself as a \"designer\": my work lies on the intersection between technology and human behavior, and as such I am focused on enhancing the interaction between users and computers through the design of Human-Centered AI applications.",
